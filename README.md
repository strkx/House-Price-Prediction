This repository contains code and resources for a house price prediction project. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and deployment components, utilizing machine learning techniques to estimate house prices based on various features.

## Features

-   Data preprocessing and exploration.
-   Model training using polynomial regression.
-   Hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance.
-   Model persistence using joblib for easy loading and deployment.
-   Flask-based web application for real-time predictions.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/strkx/House-Price-Prediction.git
    cd House-Price-Prediction
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  To run the Flask-based web application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  Access the API documentation by navigating to `/apidocs/` in your web browser.

3.  To run the prediction script directly:

    ```bash
    python prediction_regression_project.py
    ```

    The script will prompt you to enter house features, and then output the predicted price.
